# Diri terminal extensions

Pinned alacritty_terminal 0.26.0 (Apache-2.0). The metadata extension adds a
PROMPT_START cell flag and Handler::mark_prompt implementation, paired with the
OSC 133 A dispatch in vendored VTE. Markers follow the existing grid erase,
scroll, and reflow lifecycle and are ignored on the alternate screen.

This keeps prompt navigation in the authoritative parser, including synchronized
updates, instead of adding a second escape-sequence parser or guessing boundaries
from terminal text. No new runtime dependency. The source participates in the
Remote Helper Build ID. Revisit this small patch when updating the parser.

## Deferred alternate-screen allocation

The pristine alternate grid is represented by `None` until the first screen
switch. It is created at the current dimensions, then uses the original cursor,
clear, swap, resize, and reset operations. Once created, its allocation is retained
for reuse. The active primary grid and history remain eager and authoritative.

This removes one unused 80×24 grid (46,848 requested heap bytes) from terminals
that have never entered a full-screen program. The tradeoff is allocating that
grid at first entry. There is no wire or checkpoint format change. Parser source
already participates in the Remote Helper Build ID; live Holders keep their binary.

The resource gate and actual-parser screen-switch/resize/reset regressions live
in `diri-terminal-state`; run `cargo bench -p diri-terminal-state --bench
terminal_parity -- --empty-gate` from the workspace for the allocation gate.
