# Diri terminal metadata extension

Pinned alacritty_terminal 0.26.0 (Apache-2.0). The only behavior change is a
PROMPT_START cell flag and Handler::mark_prompt implementation, paired with the
OSC 133 A dispatch in vendored VTE. Markers follow the existing grid erase,
scroll, and reflow lifecycle and are ignored on the alternate screen.

This keeps prompt navigation in the authoritative parser, including synchronized
updates, instead of adding a second escape-sequence parser or guessing boundaries
from terminal text. No new runtime dependency. The source participates in the
Remote Helper Build ID. Revisit this small patch when updating the parser.
